Trying my hand at creating some famous cellular automata, and maybe inventing some new ones, using shaders

## What may appear
- Game of life
- Smooth life
- Lenia 
- Generalized smooth kernels
- Bob's brain
- Wireworld
- Huegene
- Elementary Automata

This is obviously just a list of every cellular automata I have heard of.
